NAME
----
vv_treemap - Interactive and dynamic treemap visualization of a Paje trace file


SYNOPSIS
--------
*vv_treemap* ['OPTIONS'] <TRACEFILE>


DESCRIPTION
-----------

The vv_treemap(1) command displays a dynamic, interactive and
hierarchical treemap visualization of a Paje trace file. It is dynamic
since the user can change in runtime the time slices that should be
applied to calculate the treemap. This interactivity is enhanced by
enabling the selection of specific types and containers to be
rendered. Most of the times, the user should do it in first place,
since most of the metrics registered in traces are incompatible among
them. Since the Paje trace file is naturally hierarchical (see the
trace format description for details), vv_treemap reflects that in the
representation: the user can change the level of details by using the
mouse scroll within the main window. The vv_treemap tool is a
particularly useful program to compare the behavior of
processes/threads (containers) on different time scales. If wisely
used, it can be show the imbalances that might occur in a parallel
application, for instance.  A good analysis using vv_treemap depends
on the dynamic selection of performance metrics along with a good time
slice configuration.

OPTIONS
-------

*vv_treemap* accepts the following options:    

*-a, --stop-at=TIME*::
    Stop the trace simulation at TIME. This way the user won't have to
    wait until the complete trace is loaded (and simulated) into
    memory.

*-f, --flex*::
    Use a flex-based file reader. The flex reader of PajeNG framework
    can be used in vv_treemap to allow an alternative way of reading
    trace files. In some rare situations, it might be faster to read
    trace files with this option.

*-n, --no-strict*::
    Support old file names in event definitions.

*-z, --ignore-incomplete-links*::
    Tells the PajeNG simulator to ignore incomplete links. Only use if
    you know what you are doing, since most of the times, incomplete
    links indicate a corrupted or malformed trace file.

*-?, --help*::
    Show all the available options.

*--usage*::
    Give a short usage message.
